## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to an RFP.

### Overview

Write The Future exists because in this rapidly evolving AI era, we all deserve the opportunity to write our own future. 
It is our mission to utilize the blockchain/AI/AR technologies and empower a united community to learn, thrive, and shape their future together.

Write The Future as a part of Substrate / Kusama / Polkadot / Web 3 Ecosystem:
- The need to issue NFT for certificates (when a course in our eLearning platform is completed)
- The smart contracts for our DiFi services (our wallet) and Generative AI rewards (our Zine product - AI art magazines)
- The web 3 requirement for our financial literacy game, LOOR, where each game is unique and the cards are created dynamically based on the live market movements.

We are interested in creating this project, because we are not building an app or two. We are building an ecosystem and aiming for the greatest reach possible gives us a better success rate. 
For us Polkadot landscape has all the required elements to help us succeed.

### Project Details
Write The Future is a suite of multiple products and services:

They are being released on timely fashion following strict 17 days sprints. Please see the history of what has been done so far here:
c

To give you an example. Our learn platform is where educator use AI to created interactive courses 
following Gangne's 9 events of intruction:

[![Gangne's 9 events of intruction](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-31fCUQ2htU/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-31fCUQ2htU)

Content creators get free Gen-AI tokens to create a course with 4 lessons in 30 different languages and with their prefered tone. 
(We have 12 tones here. from supportive and friendly to sarcastic. Please do not undersestimate the power of sarcasm on delivering an engaging educational contest. 
There are numerious reseacrhes to support that.)

On the student side, the courses are provided with interactive slides. No more boring videos. The course keeps students hands busy and their mind engaged and 
they won't be distracted by social media notification during the study. Bonus, if they had a question regarding a slide, AI is presented to help them. 
It is like having your own personalized instructor by your side.

After completeing the course and passing the exam they can choose to issue their certificate as NFT:

For AI artists and Generative AI enthusiast we have the Zine product with its own, magazines, contests and crypto rewards:

Please see our [whitepaper](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/wtf-workspace-ad6a4.appspot.com/o/whitepaper.pdf?alt=media&token=e055ff82-a46d-40e0-9e8f-d26ba16115f2) 
to see the products and their purposes.

Alternatively register in our [website](https://wtf.pub) and have a look around. Or take a [course](https://learn.wtf.pub/courses/itGYcOIyVRLfMWbItJGx) the explains what is our ecosystem about and how you can use it.

To provide a good foundation for maintenance and easier scale, this ecosystem is implemented using the Angular workspaces and Google Cloud. Each product has its own codebase, CI/CD pipeline 
and grow & maintenance policy whie at the same time benefits from a large shared library where all models and business logic is defined.   


What we are not going to do is implementing a platform for creating or deploying smart contracts. We are seeking an avaialable and scalable solution to cover as much ground as possible 
in the web 3 DeFi landscape while we continue our focus on developing our ecosystem.


### Ecosystem Fit

We are seeking a solution where users (content creators and cosumers aslike) can bring their own token and use it on our products and services. 
What suits us the best is a network with greate interoperability and token inclusion so we can accept one universal wallet to manage any Web 3 related requirement.
What we bring to the table is a touch AI and AR to the Polkadot landscape.
Our target audience are initially educators and their students. GIven the fact that 94% of online learners never finish the course that they've paid for, 
we decided to build an ecosystem that icetivise teachers and learners by rewarding them with Gen-AI and crypto tokens.

Also considering that there was a boost in elearning insductry right after the lockdown in 2019 and 2020 (due to Covid-19), it seems building a platform where utilizes new tech (such as AI, AR and crypto) 
to deliver a better educational content has the potential for growth.

There are famous traditional elearning platform out there and they all get a share of the market. We are not going to comepte with them in their game. Others has done that before and they fialed.
Instead we are aiming for a blue ocean strategy. There has been a few "learn to eaarn" plans in the crypto space already. But it seams none of them incorporated the AI or AR into their contents.

We believe the cross road of eLearning, AI, AR and crypto is the less explored area which worth investing.

## Development Status :open_book:
What I am building is not an idea or MVP. It is a functional and operation ecosystem with a few active product and services. Please visit the website: https://wtf.pub register and play with some of its ready products and servicves. For example in the comming weeks there will be a burst of new workshops and courses in our Learn platform.
I had the honor of writing and publishing 30 tech books mostly about programming and software design. Book number 31 titled "WhaleDrop: The Angular Way To Code, Cloud And AR" most likely will be published by Packt Publishing (UK) and will be on the shelves in 2 months.
  I believe in offering solution for existing problems. That is why before writing a book or creating a tech solution, I'm on the field doing research and talking to people. The idea of AI/Crypto powered elearning platform born out of these field researches. Students abandone their online courses, simply because after a few days/weeks they are not engage anymore. Addressing the engagement issue was at the core of our eLearning platform. Another example is the book that I just finished writing recently.
  Crypto retail had enough of airdrops and random tokens that promoted via a workdpress website. But if there is a utility token that has an ecosystem built around it and its airdrop is a WhaleDrop (they had to check the live map, spot the whale in the sky and get utility tokens as rewards - that they can spend on a real products and services- that is a winner. And this is the direction we are talking. The code is [open source](https://github.com/Soolan/book-whale-drop) and tt will come with its own crypto rewards, smart contracts, workshops and courses.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
